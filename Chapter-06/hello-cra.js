/*
You can install CRA and have it available locally for future projects. 

convenient approach is to use the npx utility that comes with Node.js. 
It allows you to execute (hence the “x”) Node package scripts. 
You can run the CRA script once: it downloads and executes the last version, 
sets up your app, and it’s gone.

To get started, create a temporary directory and execute CRA:
$ mkdir ~/reactbook/test
$ cd ~/reactbook/test
$ npx create-react-app hello
