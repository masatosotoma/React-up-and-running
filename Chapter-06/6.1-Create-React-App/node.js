/*

To install Node.js, go to https://nodejs.org and grab the installer for your operating 
system. Follow the instructions of the installer and it’s all done. Now you can avail yourself of the services provided by the command-line Node package manager (npm) utility.
Even if you have Node.js installed, 
it’s a good idea to make sure you have the latest version.
To verify, type this in your terminal:

$ npm --version

masatosotoma@MASATOs-MacBook-Pro ~ % npm --version
9.5.0
