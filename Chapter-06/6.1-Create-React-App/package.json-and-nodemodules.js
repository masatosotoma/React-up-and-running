/*
One of the configuration pieces deals with dependencies, 
such as React and React-DOM. These dependencies are installed 
in the node_modules folder in the root of the app

The dependencies there are for developing and building the app, not for deployment. 
And they should not be included if you share the code of your app with friends, 
coworkers or the open-source community

When someone else wants to contribute or you want to contribute to another app, 
you install the dependencies locally.
