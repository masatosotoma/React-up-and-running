/*Because the expressions wrapped in {} are just JavaScript, 
you can easily add multi‐ line comments using /* comment */
/*You can also add single-line comments using // comment, 
but you have to make sure the closing } of the expression is on a separate line so it’s not considered part of the comment:*/
