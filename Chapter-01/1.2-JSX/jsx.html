<!--
    When you start nesting components, you quickly end up with a lot of function calls and parentheses to keep track of.
    To make things easier, you can use the JSX syntax. JSX is a little controversial: people often find it repulsive at first sight

<!--
    This syntax looks very much like HTML
    itâ€™s not valid JavaScript that browsers can understand
    You need to transpile this code to make it work in the browser
    You need the Babel library which translates cutting-edge JavaScript (and JSX) to old school JavaScript 
    that works in ancient browsers.
