JSX is a separate technology from React and is completely optional.
You can opt into never coming anywhere near JSX at all. 
But it’s very likely that once you try it, you won’t go back to function calls.

/*
The process of transpilation is a process of taking source code and rewriting it to

A polyfill is a solution in pure JavaScript-land. 
It’s a good solution when adding new methods to existing objects or implementing new objects (such as JSON)

/*
Transpiling JavaScript is getting more and more common  as programmers want to use the latest JavaScript (ECMAScript) features 
without waiting for browsers to implement them
