      /* Taking care of these memory leaks is fairly straightforward. You need to keep references
 to the handlers and intervals/timeouts you want to clean up. Then clean them
 up in componentWillUnmount().
 For the event handler, have it as a class method, as opposed to an inline function:*/

      function keydownHandler(e) {
        if (e.altKey && e.shiftKey && e.keyCode === 82) {
          //ALT+SHIFT+R(eplay)
          this.replay();
        }
      }
