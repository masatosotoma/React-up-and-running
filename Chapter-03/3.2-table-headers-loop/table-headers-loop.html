<!--
    You can open curly braces in your JSX and put any JavaScript value or expression in there. 
    If this value happens to be an array as in the previous case, 
    the JSX parser treats it as if you passed each element of the array individually, like {headers[0]}{headers[1]}....
-->

<!--
    You can have JavaScript expressions in curly braces within JSX and you can nest them as deep as you need.
    Loops and conditions all work as usual, and you don’t need to learn another “templating” language or syntax to build the UI.
