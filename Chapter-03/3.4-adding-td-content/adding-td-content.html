<!--
    The data to be rendered is a two-dimensional array (rows and columns) that looks like the following:

    const data = [
        [ 'A Tale of Two Cities', 'Charles Dickens', 'English', '1859', '200 million',],
....
    ]


    initialData = new prop
    The caller of your Excel component should be able to pass data to initialize the table. 
    Later, as the table lives on, the data will change, because the user is able to sort, edit, and so on. 
    In other words, the state of the component will change.
    Use this.state.data to keep track of the changes and use this.props.initialData to let the caller initialize the component

    You need to add a constructor to set the initial state from the given data. 
    The constructor receives props as an argument and also needs to call its parentâ€™s constructor via super():
