<!--
    Sometimes you need to hook into an existing application or a website and migrate to React one piece at a time.
    React was designed to work with any preexisting codebase.

    One way your React app can communicate with the outside world is to get a reference 
    to a component you render with ReactDOM.render() and use it from outside of the component:
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Accessing component from outside</title>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>

    <script src="../libs/react.js"></script>
    <script src="../libs/react-dom.js"></script>

    <script src="../libs/babel.js"></script>
    <script type="text/babel">
      class TextAreaCounter extends React.Component {
        constructor() {
          super();
          this.state = {};
        }
        render() {
          const text = "text" in this.state ? this.state.text : this.props.text;
          return (
            <div>
              <textarea
                defaultValue={text}
                onChange={(event) => this.onTextChange(event)}
              />
              <h3>{text.length}</h3>
            </div>
          );
        }
        onTextChange(event) {
          this.setState({
            text: event.target.value,
          });
        }
      }

      const myTextAreaCounter = ReactDOM.render(
        <TextAreaCounter text="Bob" />,
        document.getElementById("app")
      );
      /*you can use myTextAreaCounter to access the same methods 
      and properties you normally access with this when inside the component. 
      You can even play with the component using your JavaScript console
      */
      myTextAreaCounter.setState({ text: "Hello outside world!" });
      const reactAppNode = ReactDOM.findDOMNode(myTextAreaCounter);
      //This is the first child of the <div id="app">, which is where you told React to do itsmagic.
    </script>
  </body>
