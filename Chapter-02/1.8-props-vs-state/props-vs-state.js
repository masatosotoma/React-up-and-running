/*

Properties are a mechanism for the outside world (users of the component) to configure your component. 
State is your internal data maintenance. 

if you consider an analogy with object-oriented programming, 
this.props is like a collection of all the arguments passed to a class constructor, 
while this.state is a bag of your private properties.

In general, prefer to split your application in a way that you have fewer stateful components and more stateless ones.
