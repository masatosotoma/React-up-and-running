<!--
    In the DOM world it’s common to use element.addEventListener to set up listeners 
    (which now leads to having code in two places or more) and event delegation (to address the performance issues)
    Event delegation means you listen to events at some parent node, 
    say a <div> that contains many buttons, and you set up one listener for all the buttons, 
    instead of one listener per button. Hence you delegate the event handling to a parent authority.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Event Handling in the Olden Days</title>
  </head>
  <div id="parent">
    <button id="ok">OK</button>
    <button id="cancel">Cancel</button>
  </div>

  <script>
    document
      .getElementById("parent")
      .addEventListener("click", function (event) {
        const button = event.target;

        //do different things based on which button was clicked
        switch (button.id) {
          case "ok":
            console.log("OK!");
            break;
          case "cancel":
            console.log("Cancel");
            break;
          default:
            new Error("Unexpected button ID");
        }
      });
  </script>
</html>

<!--
• Declaring the listener is further away from the UI component, which makes code harder to find and debug.
• Using delegation and always switch-ing creates unnecessary boilerplate code 
even before you get to do the actual work (responding to a button click in this case).
• Browser inconsistencies (omitted here) actually require this code to be longer.


When it comes to taking this code live in front of real users, 
you need a few more additions if you want to support old browsers:

• You need attachEvent in addition to addEventListener.
• You need const event = event || window.event; at the top of the listener.
• You need const button = event.target || event.srcElement;.
