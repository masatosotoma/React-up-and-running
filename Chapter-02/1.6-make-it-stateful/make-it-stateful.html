<!-- to turn this stateless component into a stateful one -->

<!--
    First, you need to set the initial state in the class constructor using this.state. 
    Bear in mind that the constructor is the only place where it’s OK to set the state directly without calling this.setState().

    Initializing this.state is required; if you don’t do it, consecutive access to this.state in the render() method will fail.
