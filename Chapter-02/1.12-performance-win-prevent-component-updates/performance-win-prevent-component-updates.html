<!--
    shouldComponentUpdate() = invoked before componentWillUpdate() 
    and gives you a chance to cancel the update if you decide it’s not necessary.

    There is a class of components that use only this.props and this.state in their render() methods 
    and no additional function calls. These components are called “pure” components.

    They can implement shouldComponentUpdate() and compare the state and the properties before 
    and after an update and if there aren’t any changes, return false and save some processing power. 
    Additionally, there can be pure static components that use neither props nor state. These can straight out return false

    React can make it easier to use the common (and generic) case of checking all props 
    and state in shouldComponentUpdate(): instead of repeating this work, you can have your components inherit React.
    PureComponent instead of React.Component.
