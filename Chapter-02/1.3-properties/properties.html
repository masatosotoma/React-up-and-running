<!--
  Rendering hard-coded UI in your custom components is perfectly fine and has its uses. 
  But the components can also take properties and render or behave differently,
  depending on the values of the properties. Think about the <a> element in HTML 
  and how it acts differently based on the value of the href attribute. 
  The idea of properties in React is similar (and so is the JSX syntax).
